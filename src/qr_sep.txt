Question: Martin Rackin produced software directed by whom?

Document [1]: (Title: Martin Rackin) Martin Rackin (31 July 1918 – 15 April 1976) was an American writer and producer who was briefly head of production at Paramount Pictures from 1960–64. In the late 1950s he wrote and produced a series of films with actor Alan Ladd. Richard Fleischer described Rackin as "a real character. He was a fast-talking, breezy, nervous, con man type who blinked his eyes a lot. You always had the feeling that he was some sort of a street corner shell game operator keeping an eye open for the cops." Biography. Rackin was born in New York City. He worked as an errand boy for a Times Square hat shop.
Document [2]: (Title: Alan Ladd) However, despite Ladd's presence, a series did not result. Ladd next made "Hell on Frisco Bay" (1955), a film for Jaguar, co-written by Martin Rackin and directed by Frank Tuttle, his old "This Gun for Hire" associate. Rackin wrote and produced Ladd's subsequent film, which he made for Warner Bros., titled "Santiago". For Jaguar, Ladd produced, but did not appear in "A Cry in the Night".
Document [3]: (Title: Martin Rackin) Rackin teamed up with John Lee Mahin. Both men wrote and producer "The Horse Soldiers" (1959) and "North to Alaska" (1960). Paramount. In July 1960 Rackin was appointed supervisory chief of production at Paramount Studios, a position that had been vacant since Dan Hartman left in 1956. At the time Paramount were dominated by independent production units run by producers like Hal Wallis, George Seaton and Alfred Hitchcock. (All of whom would leave Paramount in the next few years.)
