Question: Martin Rackin produced software directed by whom?

Document [1]: (Title: Martin Rackin) Martin Rackin (31 July 1918 – 15 April 1976) was an American writer and producer who was briefly head of production at Paramount Pictures from 1960–64. In the late 1950s he wrote and produced a series of films with actor Alan Ladd. Richard Fleischer described Rackin as "a real character. He was a fast-talking, breezy, nervous, con man type who blinked his eyes a lot. You always had the feeling that he was some sort of a street corner shell game operator keeping an eye open for the cops." Biography. Rackin was born in New York City. He worked as an errand boy for a Times Square hat shop.
Document [2]: (Title: Alan Ladd) However, despite Ladd's presence, a series did not result. Ladd next made "Hell on Frisco Bay" (1955), a film for Jaguar, co-written by Martin Rackin and directed by Frank Tuttle, his old "This Gun for Hire" associate. Rackin wrote and produced Ladd's subsequent film, which he made for Warner Bros., titled "Santiago". For Jaguar, Ladd produced, but did not appear in "A Cry in the Night".
Document [3]: (Title: Martin Rackin) Rackin teamed up with John Lee Mahin. Both men wrote and producer "The Horse Soldiers" (1959) and "North to Alaska" (1960). Paramount. In July 1960 Rackin was appointed supervisory chief of production at Paramount Studios, a position that had been vacant since Dan Hartman left in 1956. At the time Paramount were dominated by independent production units run by producers like Hal Wallis, George Seaton and Alfred Hitchcock. (All of whom would leave Paramount in the next few years.) It was thought Rackin's appointment might herald a return to the time when Paramount had more control over its productions.
Document [4]: (Title: Santiago (1956 film)) Santiago, also known as The Gun Runner, is a 1956 film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring and co-produced by Alan Ladd set in 1898 Cuba against the background of the Cuban War of Independence. Martin Rackin wrote the screenplay, based on his unpublished novel, as well as producing the film. Plot. A hardened gun runner attempts to take a shipment to Cuba to assist with the rebellion against Spain. Production. The project was first announced in July 1955 and was originally known as "The Greater Courage". It was based on an unpublished novel by Martin Rackin, who also acted as producer.

Question: Which film was directed and produced by Mel Brooks?

Document [1]: (Title: Life Stinks) Life Stinks is a 1991 American comedy film co-written, produced, directed by and starring Mel Brooks. It is one of the few Mel Brooks comedies that is not a parody, nor at any time does the film break the fourth wall. It co-stars Lesley Ann Warren, Howard Morris and Jeffrey Tambor. The original music score was composed by John Morris. The film was both a critical and a box-office flop. Plot. Goddard Bolt (Mel Brooks) is the callous CEO of Bolt Enterprises. Bolt shows little regard for other people's needs, or for the environment.
Document [2]: (Title: To Be or Not to Be (1983 film)) To Be or Not to Be is a 1983 American war comedy film directed by Alan Johnson, produced by Mel Brooks, and starring Mel Brooks, Anne Bancroft, Tim Matheson, Charles Durning, Christopher Lloyd, and José Ferrer. The screenplay was written by Ronny Graham and Thomas Meehan, based on the original story by Melchior Lengyel, Ernst Lubitsch and Edwin Justus Mayer. The film is a remake of the 1942 film of the same name. Connections with the original.
Document [3]: (Title: Mel Brooks) Brooks sought to purchase the rights to "84 Charing Cross Road" for his wife, Anne Bancroft, for many years. He also produced the comedy "Fatso" (1980) that Bancroft directed. In 1981, Brooks joked that the only genres that he had not spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles. "History of the World Part I" was a tongue-in-cheek look at human culture from the Dawn of Man to the French Revolution. The film was written, produced, and directed by Brooks with narration by Orson Welles. This film was another modest financial hit, earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews.
Document [4]: (Title: Mel Brooks) Released that year was the dramatic film "The Elephant Man" directed by David Lynch and produced by Brooks. Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading "Mel Brooks presents "The Elephant Man"" would expect a comedy, he set up the company Brooksfilms. Brooksfilms has since produced a number of non-comedy films, including "Frances" (1982), "The Fly" (1986), and "84 Charing Cross Road" (1987), starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft, along with comedies, including Richard Benjamin's "My Favorite Year" (1982), which was partially based on Mel Brooks's real life.

Question: Which sumos have nore than 7 championship wins ?

Document [1]: (Title: Dejima Takeharu) In May 2009, ranked at "maegashira" 12, he seemed in danger of demotion from "makuuchi" after recording only three wins in the first nine days, but he made a partial recovery to score 7–8. Retirement from sumo. In the July 2009 tournament, which came exactly ten years after his championship win, Dejima announced his retirement from active competition after suffering nine losses in the first eleven days, rather than face demotion to the second "jūryō" division. Dejima has stayed in the sumo world as a coach at Musashigawa stable (now Fujishima stable) under the elder name Ōnaruto Oyakata.
Document [2]: (Title: Tokushōryū Makoto) Despite his successes in amateur sumo, he never achieved student "yokozuna" status so was not allowed to enter professional sumo at an elevated rank (see "makushita tsukedashi") and had to start at the bottom of the ranks. His skill and experience allowed him a string of winning tournaments from his entry into sumo, and he also took the bottom division "jonokuchi" championship in his debut tournament, with a 6-1 score without a playoff(which is very rare in Sumo), followed by a perfect 7–0 "sandanme" championship in September of that same year. He was promoted to the "makushita" division in the November tournament following his championship.
Document [3]: (Title: Match-fixing in professional sumo) Like Benjamin, the authors concluded that those who already have 8 wins collude with those who are 7–7 and let them win, since the 8-win wrestlers had already secured their ranking. A possible counter-argument to the "Freakonomics" conclusion is that a 7–7 "rikishi" (sumo wrestler) was highly motivated to win his last match to gain promotion, rather than demotion, while the 8–6 rikishi had already guaranteed his promotion, so was not as motivated. The authors revealed a more damning statistic, however.
Document [4]: (Title: Ōnishiki Ittetsu) In this tournament in May 1979 at "makushita" 1 he posted a perfect 7-0 record, took the championship, and also handed Itai his first defeat in professional sumo, ending a consecutive winning streak from debut which was a record at that time. In September 1982 he became the first wrestler to immediately follow a win by default (over Koboyama) with a loss by default. He retired in January 1988 rather than face demotion to the "makushita" division again. Retirement. Onishiki remained in sumo as a "toshiyori" or elder, and was known as Yamashina Oyakata.
